## Description 

This plugin **removes** all the promotional / upsell stuff that WPForms Lite is stuffing within itself and the WordPress Admin Area. That way you are **not distracted** and can **actually just USE** the free lite version of this form builder / forms manager plugin.

Nothing more, nothing less.

It may seem not much but the removing of "stuff" will make the difference, believe me.

## Frequently Asked Questions 

### Why did you even bother and create such a plugin/snippet? 

When working on a client site some years ago other options were not possible or allowed (reasons don't matter here) and I had to use WPForms Lite. While this plugin works just fine, all the promotional "things" and the aggressive upselling got on my nerves in a way that I had to do something about it. The result of that "something" you can see and install here. ðŸ˜‰

It's completely up to you to buy the Pro Version of WPForms. I love premium plugins and have nothing against them. What I do NOT love is taking over the WordPress Admin and aggressively pressuring on my nerves when I have serious work to do. Period.


### Does this plugin/snippet add any new features? 

No. This is intentional. If you don't want my "purify" plugin/snippet you can buy the WPForms Pro version or look for any other alternative.


### Is WPForms Lite any good? 

Yes. It is a great plugin with some great and unique features. It works very well even in the free version.

## Plugin Scope / Disclaimer

This plugin comes as is.

_Disclaimer 1:_ So far I will support the plugin for breaking errors to keep it working. Otherwise support will be very limited. Also, it will NEVER be released to WordPress.org Plugin Repository for a lot of reasons (ah, thanks, Matt!).

_Disclaimer 2:_ All of the above might change. I do all this stuff only in my spare time.

_Most of all:_ Enjoy your code snippet work again. And now, have fun building great sites!!! ðŸ˜‰
